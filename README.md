# Fastapi-QueueHandler-QueueListener
This repository implements QueueHandler and QueueListener for Python's logging module, enabling non-blocking, asynchronous logging. It allows log messages to be sent to a queue and processed in a separate thread, improving application performance. Supports various handlers, including SMTP, and is easily configurable for flexible logging setups.
